Assignment 2

Task 1 (Functionality of the program)
Variable 'a' is taken as an integer input from the user.
Using % operator by 2 we check whether the answer obtain is 1 or 0 (remainder of any number when divided by 2)
In if statement, if the above calculated answer is 1 then we print "a is an odd number" and in the else we print "a is an even number".

Task 2 (Functionality of the program)
Since we will be finding the sum of 1 to 50 integers, initially we declare a variable name 'total' equal to 0.
Then we use for loop for a range from 1 to 51 (51 as in the range command the ending number has to be n+1, as here we have n=50)
In the for statement the 'total' is incremented with current value of i. The i is also incremented with 1 in each iteration.
We use print statement which executes when the loop is ended with the latest calculated value of the total.
